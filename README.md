This was a university project, our aim was to create an autonomous traffic managment system, where the traffic lights would turn on/off corresponding to the traffic change or other special events.

For the first phase we worked on an imaginary city where we created all the roads using a tool that we made.
This project consists of two parts (Microcontroller & Web), the first part sends HTTP requests to the server to keep it updated with any changes in the traffic, as 
for the second part, it includes a Login/Register screen, map drawing tool and a map showing screen.
